 # Wake Up on Button Press Using the ATmega4809 Microcontroller

This code example demonstrates how to wake up the microcontroller (MCU) from Sleep mode by pressing a button. The MCU exits Sleep mode when the button is pressed, turns on an LED and returns to Sleep mode. On button release, it exits Sleep mode, turns off the LED and goes back to Sleep mode.

## Operation

To program the ATMEGA4809 Xplained Pro board with this MPLAB速 X project, follow the steps provided in the [How to Program the ATMEGA4809 Xplained Pro Board](#how-to-program-the-atmega4809-xplained-pro-board) chapter.<br><br>

## Setup

The following configurations must be made for this project:

- Clock configured for 3.33 MHz
- Power-Down Sleep mode set
- Global interrupts enabled
- Interrupt enabled for pin PB2, the button
- Pin PB2 configured with internal pull-up

 |Pin                       | Configuration      |
 | :---------------------:  | :----------------: |
 |            PB2           |   Digital input    |
 |            PB5           |   Digital output   |

## Demo
